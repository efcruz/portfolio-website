                    Progressive web application (PWA) built with React that allows users to search for a city and get a
                    list of events hosted in that city. The events are fetched from Google Calendar API using AWS
                    Lambda as authorisation server for issuing OAuth2 authentication. It was developed following
                    test-driven development (TDD) supported by Jest.

                    This app was developed during the Full Stack Web Development course in Career Foundry to practice my
                    skills and consisted in the whole 4th achievement with the theme: Testing in the
                    Development Process.

                <span class="subtitle">1. Creating an Authorisation Server and setting up OAuth2</span>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The first thing to do was ensure that the user has access to the Google Calendar API. This was a
                    complex
                    process because involved on one hand the creation of a server to handling the authorisations
                    requests
                    and on another hand, the creation of a OAuth Consumer that actually contains the access required by
                    Google to the API.
                    As a Authorisation Server, was used the services of AWS Lambda to host serveless functions created
                    with
                    the authorisation requests. Through OAuth2 protocol, the application gain access to the API with its
                    own
                    OAuth Consumer.
                    <br>
                </p>
                <span class="subtitle">2. Testing</span>
                <br>
                <p>
                    To guarantee that every part would work properly, unit tests were setup with help of Jest, first
                    with
                    mock data then with the actual data loaded from Calendar API, followed by integration tests and user
                    acceptance tests made with Puppeteer.
                    This was the essencial topic in this project and for me, as a developer student, was a big step to
                    be
                    able to know how to prevent errors and write more structured code.
                </p>
                <span class="subtitle">3. Converting to a PWA (Progressive Web Application)</span>
                <br>
                <p>
                    A web application with the advantages of a native application: the ability to be installed (on both
                    mobile devices and computers) and the ability to work offline. Through Service Worker handle the
                    requests and responses made between the application and the data stored in the browser's cache,
                    making
                    possible the application load data even when there's no internet connection. And thanks to the Web
                    App
                    Manifest (which defines how the app will be displayed to the user ) meet app can have a look and
                    feel
                    like a native application.

                <p>
                    The most challenging task was definitely set up authorisation/authentication for Google API:
                    it is a complex logic with a lot of steps that took some time to understand but in the end
                    was a great achievement and brought a lot of new knowledge.
                    <br>
                    As the second React project, here the main focus was about testing: an essencial skill for
                    every developer and one that me, personally, enjoyed to learn. It was also interesting to
                    know how testing fase integrates the most modern development processes like CI (Continuous
                    Integration) and CD (Continuous Delivery).
